# Ocean-Dev Docker Images

[Ocean](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable) is
[D-Wave's](https://www.dwavesys.com) suite of tools for solving hard problems
with quantum computers. Ocean docker images are available in a DockerHub
repository, [`dwavesys/ocean`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dwavesys/ocean).

Ocean-Dev docker images extend Ocean images with additional development tools,
and optional non-open-source Ocean packages like
[`dwave-inspector`](https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-inspector) and
[`dwave-drivers`](https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-drivers).


## Build Matrix

- Ocean: [`{{ ocean_version }}`](https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk/releases/{{ ocean_version }})
- Python: `3.9`, `3.10`, **`3.11`** (default), `3.12`
- Platform: [`bookworm`](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBookworm), `windowsservercore`


## Architectures

All Linux images are built for `amd64` and `arm64` architectures, and are available
as multi-arch docker images.

Windows images are build for `amd64` only.


## Supported tags, with `Dockerfile` links

Simple tags represent "canonical images" and their aliases. Each simple tag maps
to an image with specific ocean version, python version, and platform.
Architecture can be shared, though; Linux simple tags point to multi-arch images.

Shared tags map to multi-platform/multi-architecture images.
